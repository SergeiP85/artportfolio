# Ivan Aivazovsky Portfolio Webpage

This project showcases a single-page portfolio website dedicated to the famous Russian marine painter, Ivan Aivazovsky. The webpage is designed with responsiveness, accessibility, and modern web standards in mind, making it a strong addition to a professional portfolio.

## Key Features

### 1. **Responsive Design**
- The website is fully responsive and adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring an optimal user experience across devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
- A mobile navigation menu is implemented using a checkbox toggle for a minimalist and user-friendly interface.

### 2. **Semantic HTML**
- The structure of the page follows semantic HTML5 principles, including the use of `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` tags.
- ARIA labels are incorporated to improve accessibility for screen readers, enhancing the user experience for visually impaired users.

### 3. **Custom SVG Icons**
- SVG icons for social media platforms (YouTube, LinkedIn, etc.) are embedded using an SVG sprite. This approach reduces redundant code and improves page performance.
- Each icon is interactive, with links opening in new tabs for user convenience.

### 4. **Typography**
- The webpage uses the [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) font, providing a clean and professional appearance.
- Fonts are loaded via Google Fonts with preconnect optimization to improve loading speed.

### 5. **Image Optimization**
- All images are provided in the modern WebP format for faster loading and reduced bandwidth consumption without compromising quality.

### 6. **CSS Architecture**
- The CSS is modular, with styles split into multiple files for maintainability (`basic.css`, `header.css`, `home.css`, etc.).
- Variables are used to centralize and manage key style properties, such as colors and typography, ensuring consistent styling across the site.

### 7. **Interactive Features**
- A "burger menu" for mobile navigation allows users to access sections effortlessly.
- Buttons and links include hover effects for improved interactivity and visual feedback.

### 8. **Multilingual Content**
- The "About" section includes text in both Russian and English, catering to a diverse audience.

### 9. **Well-Structured Content**
- The webpage highlights important aspects of Aivazovsky's life and work, organized into clearly defined sections:
  - **Home:** Overview of Ivan Aivazovsky and his significance.
  - **About:** Detailed biography in Russian and English.
  - **History:** Historical context and birthplace details.
  - **Portfolio:** Gallery of iconic paintings with descriptions in both languages.
  - **Contacts:** Links to external resources and social media profiles.

### 10. **Accessibility Enhancements**
